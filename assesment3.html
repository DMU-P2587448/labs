<h1> Why Cats Are Great? </h1>

<p> Cats are very family animals, they attract to their owners and often do not let them get up from the seat
  because they are besieging their knees and want to be petted. Although common opinion may say otherwise, many cats are very loyal to their family members,
  for example cats know when members of the house come home from work or school and wait for them on the windowsill, at the door, or in a common area.  </p>
