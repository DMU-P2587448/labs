<h3> Why I Like These? </h3>

<!-- This is a paragraph element -->
<p> Some might think that my favourite toppings are bland, however I disagree. This is because these
toppings have a lot of flavour when combined together in the right proportions. Also, it is important to know
that I never have all of the above toppings on my pizza at once. This is because:
<!-- This is an ordered list element nested inside a paragraph element -->
<ol>
  <li> Not all of the toppings complement each other </li>
  <li> It would be too much to have on your pizza, making it hard to consume </li>
  <li>  </li>

</ol>
